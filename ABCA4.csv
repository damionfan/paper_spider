Expanding the Mutation Spectrum in ABCA4: Sixty Novel Disease Causing Variants and Their Associated Phenotype in a Large French Stargardt Cohort.,"Nassisi M,, Mohand-Saïd S,, Dhaenens CM, Boyard F, Démontant V, Andrieu C, Antonio A, Condroyer C, Foussard M, Méjécase C, Eandi CM, Sahel JA,,,,, Zeitz C, Audo I,,.","Here we report novel mutations in ABCA4 with the underlying phenotype in a large French cohort with autosomal recessive Stargardt disease. The DNA samples of 397 index subjects were analyzed in exons and flanking intronic regions of ABCA4 (NM_000350.2) by microarray analysis and direct Sanger sequencing. At the end of the screening, at least two likely pathogenic mutations were found in 302 patients (76.1%) while 95 remained unsolved: 40 (10.1%) with no variants identified, 52 (13.1%) with one heterozygous mutation, and 3 (0.7%) with at least one variant of uncertain significance (VUS). Sixty-three novel variants were identified in the cohort. Three of them were variants of uncertain significance. The other 60 mutations were classified as likely pathogenic or pathogenic, and were identified in 61 patients (15.4%). The majority of those were missense (55%) followed by frameshift and nonsense (30%), intronic (11.7%) variants, and in-frame deletions (3.3%). Only patients with variants never reported in literature were further analyzed herein. Recruited subjects underwent complete ophthalmic examination including best corrected visual acuity, kinetic and static perimetry, color vision test, full-field and multifocal electroretinography, color fundus photography, short-wavelength and near-infrared fundus autofluorescence imaging, and spectral domain optical coherence tomography. Clinical evaluation of each subject confirms the tendency that truncating mutations lead to a more severe phenotype with electroretinogram (ERG) impairment (p = 0.002) and an earlier age of onset (p = 0.037). Our study further expands the mutation spectrum in the exonic and flanking regions of ABCA4 underlying Stargardt disease."

Ultrastructural alterations in the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors of a Stargardt patient and three Stargardt mouse models: indication for the central role of RPE melanin in oxidative stress.,"Taubitz T, Tschulakow AV, Tikhonovich M, Illing B, Fang Y, Biesemeier A, Julien-Schraermeyer S, Schraermeyer U.","Stargardt disease (SD) is characterized by the accumulation of the age-pigment lipofuscin in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and subsequent neuroretinal degeneration. The disease leads to vision loss early in life. Here, we investigate age-dependent ultrastructural changes in three SD mouse models: albino Abca4 and pigmented Abca4 and Abca4.Rdh8 mice. Since we found indications for oxidative stress primarily in albino SD mice, we tested RPE melanin for its antioxidative capabilities."
Protective effect of a locked retinal chromophore analogue against light-induced retinal degeneration.,"Gao S, Parmar T, Palczewska G, Dong Z, Golczak M, Palczewski K, Jastrzebska B.","Continuous regeneration of the 11-cis-retinal visual chromophore from all-trans-retinal is critical for vision. Insufficiency of 11-cis-retinal arising from the dysfunction of key proteins involved in its regeneration can impair retinal health, ultimately leading to loss of human sight. Delayed recovery of visual sensitivity and night blindness caused by inadequate regeneration of the visual pigment rhodopsin, are typical early signs of this condition. Excessive concentrations of unliganded, constitutively active opsin and increased levels of all-trans-retinal, and its byproducts in photoreceptors also accelerate retinal degeneration following light exposure. Exogenous 9-cis-retinal iso-chromophore can reduce the toxicity of ligand-free opsin but fails to prevent the buildup of retinoid photoproducts when their clearance is defective in human retinopathies such as Stargardt disease or age-related macular degeneration. Here we evaluated the effect of a locked chromophore analogue, 11-cis-6-membered ring-retinal against bright light-induced retinal degeneration in Abca4Rdh8 mice. Using in vivo imaging techniques, optical coherence tomography, scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, and two-photon microscopy, along with in vitro histological analysis of retinal morphology, we found that treatment with 11-cis-6-membered ring-retinal prior to light stimulation prevented rod and cone photoreceptor degradation and preserved functional acuity in these mice. Moreover, additive accumulation of 11-cis-6-membered ring-retinal measured in the eyes of these mice by quantitative liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry indicated stable binding of this retinoid to opsin. Together, these results suggest that eliminating excess of unliganded opsin can prevent light-induced retinal degeneration in Abca4Rdh8 mice."

A non-retinoid antagonist of retinol-binding protein 4 rescues phenotype in a model of Stargardt disease without inhibiting the visual cycle.,"Racz B, Varadi A, Kong J, Allikmets R,, Pearson PG, Johnson G, Cioffi CL, Petrukhin K.","A primary pathological defect in the heritable eye disorder Stargardt disease is excessive accumulation of cytotoxic lipofuscin bisretinoids in the retina. Age-dependent accumulation of lipofuscin in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) matches the age-dependent increase in the incidence of the atrophic (dry) form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and therefore may be one of several pathogenic factors contributing to AMD progression. Lipofuscin bisretinoid synthesis in the retina depends on the influx of serum retinol from the circulation into the RPE. Formation of the tertiary retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4)-transthyretin-retinol complex in the serum is required for this influx. Herein, we report the pharmacological effects of the non-retinoid RBP4 antagonist, BPN-14136. BPN-14136 dosing in the Abca4 mouse model of increased lipofuscinogenesis significantly reduced serum RBP4 levels and inhibited bisretinoid synthesis, and this inhibition correlated with a partial reduction in visual cycle retinoids such as retinaldehydes serving as bisretinoid precursors. BPN-14136 administration at doses inducing maximal serum RBP4 reduction did not produce changes in the rate of the visual cycle, consistent with minimal changes in dark adaptation. Abca4 mice exhibited dysregulation of the complement system in the retina, and BPN-14136 administration normalized the retinal levels of proinflammatory complement cascade components such as complement factors D and H, C-reactive protein, and C3. We conclude that BPN-14136 has several beneficial characteristics, combining inhibition of bisretinoid synthesis and reduction in retinaldehydes with normalization of the retinal complement system. BPN-14136, or a similar compound, may be a promising drug candidate to manage Stargardt disease and dry AMD."

Extremely hypomorphic and severe deep intronic variants in the ABCA4 locus result in varying Stargardt disease phenotypes.,"Zernant J, Lee W, Nagasaki T, Collison FT, Fishman GA, Bertelsen M, Rosenberg T, Gouras P, Tsang SH, Allikmets R.","Autosomal recessive Stargardt disease (STGD1, MIM 248200) is caused by mutations in the ABCA4 gene. Complete sequencing of the ABCA4 locus in STGD1 patients identifies two expected disease-causing alleles in ~75% of patients and only one mutation in ~15% of patients. Recently, many possibly pathogenic variants in deep intronic sequences of ABCA4 have been identified in the latter group. We extended our analyses of deep intronic ABCA4 variants and determined that one of these, c.4253+43G&gt;A (rs61754045), is present in 29/1155 (2.6%) of STGD1 patients. The variant is found at statistically significantly higher frequency in patients with only one pathogenic ABCA4 allele, 23/160 (14.38%), MAF=0.072, compared to MAF=0.013 in all STGD1 cases and MAF=0.006 in the matching general population (P&lt;1x10-7). The variant, which is not predicted to have any effect on splicing, is the first reported intronic ""extremely hypomorphic allele"" in the ABCA4 locus; i.e., it is pathogenic only when in trans with a loss-of-function ABCA4 allele. It results in a distinct clinical phenotype characterized by late-onset of symptoms and foveal sparing. In ~70% of cases the variant was allelic with the c.6006-609T&gt;A (rs575968112) variant, which was deemed non-pathogenic. Another rare deep intronic variant, c.5196+1056A&gt;G (rs886044749), found in 5/834 (0.6%) of STGD1 cases is, conversely, a severe allele. This study determines pathogenicity for three non-coding variants in STGD1 patients of European descent accounting for ~3% of the disease. Defining disease-associated alleles in the non-coding sequences of the ABCA4 locus can be accomplished by integrated clinical and genetic analyses."

Correlating the Expression and Functional Activity of ABCA4 Disease Variants With the Phenotype of Patients With Stargardt Disease.,"Garces F, Jiang K, Molday LL, Stöhr H, Weber BH, Lyons CJ, Maberley D, Molday RS,.","Stargardt disease (STGD1), the most common early-onset recessive macular degeneration, is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA4. Although extensive genetic studies have identified more than 1000 mutations that cause STGD1 and related ABCA4-associated diseases, few studies have investigated the extent to which mutations affect the biochemical properties of ABCA4. The purpose of this study was to correlate the expression and functional activities of missense mutations in ABCA4 identified in a cohort of Canadian patients with their clinical phenotype."
A novel small molecule chaperone of rod opsin and its potential therapy for retinal degeneration.,"Chen Y,,, Chen Y,, Jastrzebska B,, Golczak M,, Gulati S,, Tang H, Seibel W, Li X, Jin H, Han Y, Gao S, Zhang J, Liu X, Heidari-Torkabadi H, Stewart PL,, Harte WE, Tochtrop GP, Palczewski K,.","Rhodopsin homeostasis is tightly coupled to rod photoreceptor cell survival and vision. Mutations resulting in the misfolding of rhodopsin can lead to autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP), a progressive retinal degeneration that currently is untreatable. Using a cell-based high-throughput screen (HTS) to identify small molecules that can stabilize the P23H-opsin mutant, which causes most cases of adRP, we identified a novel pharmacological chaperone of rod photoreceptor opsin, YC-001. As a non-retinoid molecule, YC-001 demonstrates micromolar potency and efficacy greater than 9-cis-retinal with lower cytotoxicity. YC-001 binds to bovine rod opsin with an EC<sub>50</sub> similar to 9-cis-retinal. The chaperone activity of YC-001 is evidenced by its ability to rescue the transport of multiple rod opsin mutants in mammalian cells. YC-001 is also an inverse agonist that non-competitively antagonizes rod opsin signaling. Significantly, a single dose of YC-001 protects Abca4  Rdh8  mice from bright light-induced retinal degeneration, suggesting its broad therapeutic potential."

ABCA4,Expanding the Mutation Spectrum in ABCA4: Sixty Novel Disease Causing Variants and Their Associated Phenotype in a Large French Stargardt Cohort., 2018 Jul 27,"Nassisi M,, Mohand-Saïd S,, Dhaenens CM, Boyard F, Démontant V, Andrieu C, Antonio A, Condroyer C, Foussard M, Méjécase C, Eandi CM, Sahel JA,,,,, Zeitz C, Audo I,,.","Here we report novel mutations in ABCA4 with the underlying phenotype in a large French cohort with autosomal recessive Stargardt disease. The DNA samples of 397 index subjects were analyzed in exons and flanking intronic regions of ABCA4 (NM_000350.2) by microarray analysis and direct Sanger sequencing. At the end of the screening, at least two likely pathogenic mutations were found in 302 patients (76.1%) while 95 remained unsolved: 40 (10.1%) with no variants identified, 52 (13.1%) with one heterozygous mutation, and 3 (0.7%) with at least one variant of uncertain significance (VUS). Sixty-three novel variants were identified in the cohort. Three of them were variants of uncertain significance. The other 60 mutations were classified as likely pathogenic or pathogenic, and were identified in 61 patients (15.4%). The majority of those were missense (55%) followed by frameshift and nonsense (30%), intronic (11.7%) variants, and in-frame deletions (3.3%). Only patients with variants never reported in literature were further analyzed herein. Recruited subjects underwent complete ophthalmic examination including best corrected visual acuity, kinetic and static perimetry, color vision test, full-field and multifocal electroretinography, color fundus photography, short-wavelength and near-infrared fundus autofluorescence imaging, and spectral domain optical coherence tomography. Clinical evaluation of each subject confirms the tendency that truncating mutations lead to a more severe phenotype with electroretinogram (ERG) impairment (p = 0.002) and an earlier age of onset (p = 0.037). Our study further expands the mutation spectrum in the exonic and flanking regions of ABCA4 underlying Stargardt disease."
ABCA4,Deep Scleral Exposure: A Degenerative Outcome of End-Stage Stargardt Disease., 2018 Jul 25,"Lee W, Zernant J, Nagasaki T, Tsang SH, Allikmets R.","PURPOSE: To describe a distinct phenotypic outcome of outer retinal degeneration in a cohort of genetically confirmed patients with recessive Stargardt disease (STGD1).DESIGN: Retrospective case series METHODS: Twelve patients, who were clinically diagnosed with STGD1 and exhibited a unique degenerative phenotype, were included in the study. The expected two disease-causing mutations were found in all patients by direct sequencing of the ABCA4 gene. Clinical characterization of patients were defined on fundus photographs, autofluorescence images (488-nm and 532-nm, excitation), spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), and full-field electroretinogram testing (ffERG).RESULTS: Mean age at initial presentation was 67.8 years and reported age of symptomatic onset was 14.1 years (mean disease duration = 53.8 years). Best-corrected visual acuity ranged from 20/400 to hand motion. All patients exhibited advanced degeneration across the posterior pole resulting in a reflectively pale, blonde fundus due to unobstructed exposure of the underlying sclera. SD-OCT revealed complete loss of the outer retinal bands (ELM, EZ, IZ and RPE) and choroidal layers. Scotopic and photopic waveforms on ffERG were non-recordable or severely attenuated in eight patients who were tested.CONCLUSIONS: Widespread scleral exposure is a clinical outcome in a subset of STGD1 following a long duration of disease progression (∼50 years). The blonde fundus in such cases may exhibit phenotypic overlap and shared therapeutic implications with other aggressive chorioretinal dystrophies such as end-stage choroideremia, gyrate atrophy or RPE65-Leber congenital amaurosis.<p class=""copyright"">Copyright © 2018.

ABCA4,Ultrastructural alterations in the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors of a Stargardt patient and three Stargardt mouse models: indication for the central role of RPE melanin in oxidative stress., 2018 Jul 19,"Taubitz T, Tschulakow AV, Tikhonovich M, Illing B, Fang Y, Biesemeier A, Julien-Schraermeyer S, Schraermeyer U.","Background: Stargardt disease (SD) is characterized by the accumulation of the age-pigment lipofuscin in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and subsequent neuroretinal degeneration. The disease leads to vision loss early in life. Here, we investigate age-dependent ultrastructural changes in three SD mouse models: albino Abca4 and pigmented Abca4 and Abca4.Rdh8 mice. Since we found indications for oxidative stress primarily in albino SD mice, we tested RPE melanin for its antioxidative capabilities.Methods: SD mouse eyes were investigated by light, fluorescence and electron microscopy and were compared to the respective albino and pigmented wild type mice and to a human donor SD eye. To confirm the role of RPE melanin in scavenging oxidative stress, melanin from S. officinalis as a standard and porcine RPE were tested for their capability to quench superoxide anions.Results: Histological alterations indicative of oxidative stress and/or lysosomal dysfunction were present in albino Abca4 and Abca4.Rdh8 mice. Retinal damage, such as inner segment rupture and pyknotic or free photoreceptor nuclei in the subretinal space and RPE vacuolization were exclusively found in albino Abca4 mice. Shortened and disorganized photoreceptor outer segments and dead RPE cells were found in albino Abca4 and Abca4.Rdh8 mice, with earlier onset in albino Abca4 mice. Undegraded phagosomes and lipofuscin accumulation were present in the RPE of all three SD strains, but numbers were highest in Abca4.Rdh8 mice. Lipofuscin morphology differed between SD strains: (melano-)lipofuscin granules in pigmented Abca4 mice had a homogenous electron density and sharp demarcations, while lipofuscin in albino Abca4 mice had a flocculent electron density and often lacked a surrounding membrane, indicating loss of lysosomal integrity. Young Abca4.Rdh8 mice showed (melano-)lipofuscin granules with homogenous electron density, while in aged animals granules with flocculent electron density predominated. Both strains of pigmented SD mice had melanolipofuscin clusters as found in the human SD eye. Like melanin from S. officinalis, porcine RPE melanin can also quench superoxide anions.Discussion: The presented pathologies in albino Abca4 and Abca4.Rdh8 mice suggest oxidative stress and/or lysosomal dysfunction within the RPE. Since albino Abca4 mice have the earliest onset and severest damage and as absence of melanin and also melanin turnover with age are known to diminish RPEs anti-oxidative properties, we assume that RPE melanin plays a role in SD related damages. A lack of pathology in pigmented Abca4 mice due to lower stress levels as compared to the Abca4.Rdh8 mice underlines this hypothesis. It is also supported by the finding that RPE melanin can quench superoxide anions. We therefore suppose that RPE melanin is important in retinal health and we discuss its role as an oxidative stress scavenger."
ABCA4,Protective effect of a locked retinal chromophore analogue against light-induced retinal degeneration., 2018 Jul 17,"Gao S, Parmar T, Palczewska G, Dong Z, Golczak M, Palczewski K, Jastrzebska B.","Continuous regeneration of the 11-cis-retinal visual chromophore from all-trans-retinal is critical for vision. Insufficiency of 11-cis-retinal arising from the dysfunction of key proteins involved in its regeneration can impair retinal health, ultimately leading to loss of human sight. Delayed recovery of visual sensitivity and night blindness caused by inadequate regeneration of the visual pigment rhodopsin, are typical early signs of this condition. Excessive concentrations of unliganded, constitutively active opsin and increased levels of all-trans-retinal, and its byproducts in photoreceptors also accelerate retinal degeneration following light exposure. Exogenous 9-cis-retinal iso-chromophore can reduce the toxicity of ligand-free opsin but fails to prevent the buildup of retinoid photoproducts when their clearance is defective in human retinopathies such as Stargardt disease or age-related macular degeneration. Here we evaluated the effect of a locked chromophore analogue, 11-cis-6-membered ring-retinal against bright light-induced retinal degeneration in Abca4Rdh8 mice. Using in vivo imaging techniques, optical coherence tomography, scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, and two-photon microscopy, along with in vitro histological analysis of retinal morphology, we found that treatment with 11-cis-6-membered ring-retinal prior to light stimulation prevented rod and cone photoreceptor degradation and preserved functional acuity in these mice. Moreover, additive accumulation of 11-cis-6-membered ring-retinal measured in the eyes of these mice by quantitative liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry indicated stable binding of this retinoid to opsin. Together, these results suggest that eliminating excess of unliganded opsin can prevent light-induced retinal degeneration in Abca4Rdh8 mice."
ABCA4,Clinical and Genetic Characteristics Analysis of Korean Patients with Stargardt Disease Using Targeted Exome Sequencing., 2018 Jul 4,"Sung Y, Choi SW, Shim SH, Song WK.","PURPOSE: To investigate genetic mutations in Korean patients with Stargardt disease (STGD) using exome sequencing, and to analyze the correlations between genetic mutations and clinical phenotypes.METHODS: Peripheral venous blood was obtained from 24 clinically diagnosed Korean STGD patients, followed by extraction of genomic DNAs. Using exome sequencing we investigated gene mutations for the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette, subfamily A, member 4 (ABCA4) elongation of very-long-chain fatty acids 4 (ELOVL4), and prominin 1 (PROM1), and confirmed gene mutations by the direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products.RESULTS: ABCA4 mutations were confirmed in 17 of 24 patients, and 12 novel mutations were identified. ELOVL4 and PROM1 gene mutations were not identified in this study. We also identified 16 previously reported mutations related to STGD1. In patients whose disease symptoms occurred before 20 years of age, visual acuity was poorer and atrophic flecks were more frequently found. In addition, more ABCA4 mutations were found in patients who had choroidal silence or atrophic flecks.CONCLUSIONS: Novel ABCA4 gene mutations were found in Korean patients with STGD1. This study will facilitate better understanding of the relationships between ABCA4 gene mutations and clinical symptoms in Korean patients.<p class=""copyright"">© 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel."
ABCA4,The Common ABCA4 Variant p.Asn1868Ile Shows Nonpenetrance and Variable Expression of Stargardt Disease When Present in trans With Severe Variants., 2018 Jul 2,"Runhart EH,, Sangermano R,,, Cornelis SS,, Verheij JBGM, Plomp AS, Boon CJF,, Lugtenberg D, Roosing S,, Bax NM, Blokland EAW, Jacobs-Camps MHM, van der Velde-Visser SD, Pott JR, Rohrschneider K, Thiadens AAHJ,, Klaver CCW,,, van den Born LI, Hoyng CB, Cremers FPM,.","Purpose: To assess the occurrence and the disease expression of the common p.Asn1868Ile variant in patients with Stargardt disease (STGD1) harboring known, monoallelic causal ABCA4 variants.Methods: The coding and noncoding regions of ABCA4 were sequenced in 67 and 63 STGD1 probands respectively, harboring monoallelic ABCA4 variants. In case p.Asn1868Ile was detected, segregation analysis was performed whenever possible. Probands and affected siblings harboring p.Asn1868Ile without additional variants in cis were clinically evaluated retrospectively. Two asymptomatic siblings carrying the same ABCA4 variants as their probands were clinically examined. The penetrance of p.Asn1868Ile was calculated using allele frequency data of ABCA4 variants in non-Finnish European individuals.Results: The p.Asn1868Ile variant was found in cis with known variants in 14/67 probands. In 27/67 probands, we identified p.Asn1868Ile without additional variants in cis, in combination with known, mainly severe ABCA4 variants. In 23/27 probands, the trans configuration was established. Among 27 probands and 6/7 STGD1 siblings carrying p.Asn1868Ile, 42% manifested late-onset disease (&gt;44 years). We additionally identified four asymptomatic relatives carrying a combination of a severe variant and p.Asn1868Ile; ophthalmologic examination in two persons did not reveal STGD1. Based on ABCA4 allele frequency data, we conservatively estimated the penetrance of p.Asn1868Ile, when present in trans with a severe variant, to be below 5%.Conclusions: A significant fraction of genetically unexplained STGD1 cases carries p.Asn1868Ile as a second variant. Our findings suggest exceptional differences in disease expression or even nonpenetrance of this ABCA4 variant, pointing toward an important role for genetic or environmental modifiers in STGD1."

Study visits were every 6 months over a period ranging from 6 to 24 months, and also included fundus autofluorescence (FAF).RESULTS: SMART enrolled 118 participants (118 eyes). At the first visit of SMART, the mean sensitivity in mesopic microperimetry was 11.48 (±5.05; range 0.00-19.88) dB and in sMP 11.25 (±5.26; 0-19.25) dB. For FAF, all eyes had a lesion of decreased autofluorescence (mean lesion size 3.62 [±3.48; 0.10-21.46] mm2), and a total of 76 eyes (65.5%) had a lesion of definitely decreased autofluorescence with a mean lesion size of 3.46 (±3.60; 0.21-21.46) mm2.CONCLUSIONS: Rod function is impaired in STGD1 and can be assessed by sMP. Testing rod function may serve as a potential outcome measure for future clinical treatment trials. This is evaluated in the SMART study.<p class=""copyright"">© 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel."
ABCA4,Vitamin A in Stargardt disease-an evidence-based update., 2018 Jun 25,"Federspiel CA, Bertelsen M, Kessel L,.","BACKGROUND: High intake of vitamin A is suspected to be a risk factor for the progression of Stargardt disease (STGD1) and many health authorities recommend Stargardt patients not to use oral vitamin A supplements outside that provided naturally in the food. The present study provides the first systematic review of the current level of evidence regarding the role of supplementary vitamin A in STGD1.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic scientific literature search in the Pubmed database on studies reporting on the effect of oral vitamin A or serum retinol on visual function.RESULTS: In animal studies neither high nor low serum retinol in an Abca4 knockout mouse model of Stargardt showed any effect on electroretinography (ERG). In humans, significantly better visual function was reported in a cross-sectional study of patients with a low dietary intake of vitamin A, whereas a prospective study did not find any correlation between vitamin A supplementation and visual acuity. A newly introduced vitamin A substitute (C20-D(3)-vitamin A) has shown promising effects on ERG in a Stargardt mouse model.CONCLUSIONS: There are few studies on the effect of vitamin A in STGD1. The scarcity and inconclusiveness of evidence available impel further research efforts to reach a more confident conclusion. Currently, recommendations to avoid vitamin A dietary supplementation rely mainly on a theoretical background. Animal studies on vitamin A substitute as a possible therapeutic approach in preventing or slowing vision loss in STGD1 seems promising but further clinical trials are needed to verify the results."
ABCA4,Detailed genetic characteristics of an international large cohort of patients with Stargardt disease: ProgStar study report 8., 2018 Jun 20,"Fujinami K,,,, Strauss RW,,,,, Chiang JP, Audo IS,, Bernstein PS, Birch DG, Bomotti SM, Cideciyan AV, Ervin AM, Marino MJ, Sahel JA,,, Mohand-Said S,, Sunness JS, Traboulsi EI, West S, Wojciechowski R, Zrenner E,, Michaelides M,, Scholl HPN,; On behalf of the ProgStar Study Group; ProgStar Study Group.","BACKGROUND/AIMS: To describe the genetic characteristics of the cohort enrolled in the international multicentre progression of Stargardt disease 1 (STGD1) studies (ProgStar) and to determine geographic differences based on the allele frequency.METHODS: 345 participants with a clinical diagnosis of STGD1 and harbouring at least one disease-causing ABCA4 variant were enrolled from 9 centres in the USA and Europe. All variants were reviewed and in silico analysis was performed including allele frequency in public databases and pathogenicity predictions. Participants with multiple likely pathogenic variants were classified into four national subgroups (USA, UK, France, Germany), with subsequent comparison analysis of the allele frequency for each prevalent allele.RESULTS: 211 likely pathogenic variants were identified in the total cohort, including missense (63%), splice site alteration (18%), stop (9%) and others. 50 variants were novel. Exclusively missense variants were detected in 139 (50%) of 279 patients with multiple pathogenic variants. The three most prevalent variants of these patients with multiple pathogenic variants were p.G1961E (15%), p.G863A (7%) and c.5461-10 T&gt;C (5%). Subgroup analysis revealed a statistically significant difference between the four recruiting nations in the allele frequency of nine variants.CONCLUSIONS: There is a large spectrum of ABCA4 sequence variants, including 50 novel variants, in a well-characterised cohort thereby further adding to the unique allelic heterogeneity in STGD1. Approximately half of the cohort harbours missense variants only, indicating a relatively mild phenotype of the ProgStar cohort. There are significant differences in allele frequencies between nations, although the three most prevalent variants are shared as frequent variants.<p class=""copyright"">© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

ABCA4,Visual Acuity Change Over 24 Months and its Association With Foveal Phenotype and Genotype in Individuals With Stargardt Disease: ProgStar Study Report No. 10., 2018 Jun 14,"Kong X,,, Fujinami K,,,, Strauss RW,,,, Munoz B, West SK, Cideciyan AV, Michaelides M,, Ahmed M, Ervin AM,, Schönbach E, Cheetham JK, Scholl HPN,,; ProgStar Study Group.","Importance: Limited data from prospective studies are available to understand the natural history of ABCA4-related Stargardt disease (STGD1). Such data are important for determining appropriate outcome measures for future STGD1 trials.Objective: To estimate the rate of loss of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) during 2 years and to estimate the associations of BCVA loss with foveal phenotype and genotype in patients with STGD1.Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter prospective cohort study included 259 participants (489 study eyes) with molecularly confirmed STGD1 who were 6 years or older. The participants were enrolled at 9 centers in the United States and Europe and were followed up every 6 months for 2 years.Exposures: Baseline BCVA and presence and type of foveal lesion (determined via fundus autofluorescence images) and genotype (classified into 4 groups based on the number and pathogenicity of ABCA4 mutations).Main Outcomes and Measures: Rate of BCVA change per year.Results: The mean (SD) age was 33 (15) years. Of 259 the participants, 141 (54%) were female, and 222 (85%) were white. The overall rate of BCVA loss was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.20-0.90) letters per year during the 2 years. Eyes with baseline BCVA worse than 20/200 showed an improvement of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.1-1.2) letters per year. At baseline, the mean BCVA for eyes without foveal lesion was 20/32, and their BCVA change rate over time was 0.1 (95% CI, -1.2 to 1.35) letters per year (P = .89). Eyes with a foveal lesion but having BCVA of 20/70 or better at baseline lost BCVA at a rate of 3 (95% CI, 1.5-4.4) letters per year (P &lt; .001). Genotype was neither associated with baseline BCVA nor with the rate of BCVA change during the follow-up.Conclusions and Relevance: A clinically small BCVA loss was observed during 2 years, and the change rate varied depending on baseline BCVA. Eyes without lesion in the fovea had better BCVA at baseline and showed minimal change of BCVA throughout 2 years. Eyes with no or modest acuity impairment but with a foveal lesion at baseline had the fastest loss rate. For trials of STGD1 with 2 years of duration, it may be difficult to show efficacy using BCVA as an end point owing to its slow rate of change over this time."
ABCA4,Longitudinal Changes of Fixation Location and Stability Within 12 Months in Stargardt Disease: ProgStar Report No. 12., 2018 Jun 8,"Schönbach EM, Strauss RW, Kong X, Muñoz B, Ibrahim MA, Sunness JS, Birch DG, Hahn GA, Nasser F, Zrenner E, Sadda SR, West SK, Scholl HPN; ProgStar Study Group.","PURPOSE: To investigate the natural history of Stargardt disease (STGD1) using fixation location and fixation stability.DESIGN: Multicenter, international, prospective cohort study.METHODS: Fixation testing was performed using the Nidek MP-1 microperimeter as part of the prospective, multicenter, natural history study on the Progression of Stargardt disease (ProgStar). A total of 238 patients with ABCA4-related STGD1 were enrolled at baseline (bilateral enrollment in 86.6%) and underwent repeat testing at months 6 and 12.RESULTS: Outcome measures included the distance of the preferred retinal locus from the fovea (PRL) and the bivariate contour ellipse area (BCEA). After 12 months of follow-up, the change in the eccentricity of the PRL from the anatomic fovea was -0.0014 degrees (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.27 degrees, 0.27 degrees; P = .99). The deterioration in the stability of fixation as expressed by a larger BCEA encompassing 1 standard deviation of all fixation points was 1.21 degrees squared (deg2) (95% CI, -1.23 deg2, 3.65 deg2; P = .33). Eyes with increases and decreases in PRL eccentricity and/or BCEA values were observed.CONCLUSIONS: Our observations point to the complexity of fixation parameters. The association of increasingly eccentric and unstable fixation with longer disease duration that is typically found in cross-sectional studies may be countered within individual patients by poorly understood processes like neuronal adaptation. Nevertheless, fixation parameters may serve as useful secondary outcome parameters in selected cases and for counseling patients to explain changes to their visual functionality.<p class=""copyright"">Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

ABCA4,A non-retinoid antagonist of retinol-binding protein 4 rescues phenotype in a model of Stargardt disease without inhibiting the visual cycle., 2018 Jul 20,"Racz B, Varadi A, Kong J, Allikmets R,, Pearson PG, Johnson G, Cioffi CL, Petrukhin K.","A primary pathological defect in the heritable eye disorder Stargardt disease is excessive accumulation of cytotoxic lipofuscin bisretinoids in the retina. Age-dependent accumulation of lipofuscin in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) matches the age-dependent increase in the incidence of the atrophic (dry) form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and therefore may be one of several pathogenic factors contributing to AMD progression. Lipofuscin bisretinoid synthesis in the retina depends on the influx of serum retinol from the circulation into the RPE. Formation of the tertiary retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4)-transthyretin-retinol complex in the serum is required for this influx. Herein, we report the pharmacological effects of the non-retinoid RBP4 antagonist, BPN-14136. BPN-14136 dosing in the Abca4 mouse model of increased lipofuscinogenesis significantly reduced serum RBP4 levels and inhibited bisretinoid synthesis, and this inhibition correlated with a partial reduction in visual cycle retinoids such as retinaldehydes serving as bisretinoid precursors. BPN-14136 administration at doses inducing maximal serum RBP4 reduction did not produce changes in the rate of the visual cycle, consistent with minimal changes in dark adaptation. Abca4 mice exhibited dysregulation of the complement system in the retina, and BPN-14136 administration normalized the retinal levels of proinflammatory complement cascade components such as complement factors D and H, C-reactive protein, and C3. We conclude that BPN-14136 has several beneficial characteristics, combining inhibition of bisretinoid synthesis and reduction in retinaldehydes with normalization of the retinal complement system. BPN-14136, or a similar compound, may be a promising drug candidate to manage Stargardt disease and dry AMD."

Blood and retinal fatty acid analysis was performed using gas chromatography to adjust the blood AA/EPA ∼1 to 1.5. Eyecups were histologically examined using transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy to evaluate lipofuscin granules and the photoreceptor layer. Retinal N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine (A2E), a major component of retinal pigment epithelium lipofuscin, was quantified using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry, in addition to retinal proteomic analysis to determine changes in inflammatory proteins.Results: EPA levels increased and AA levels decreased in the blood and retinas of the treatment group. Significantly less A2E and lipofuscin granules were observed in the treatment group. The thickness of the outer nuclear layer was significantly greater in the treatment group (75.66 ± 4.80 μm) than in the wild-type (61.40 ± 1.84 μm) or untreated ABCA4 (56.50 ± 3.24 μm) groups. Proteomic analysis indicated lower levels of complement component 3 (C3) in the treatment group, indicative of lower complement-induced inflammatory response.Conclusions: Three months of ω3 supplementation (AA/EPA ∼1-1.5) reduces A2E levels, lipofuscin granules, and C3 levels in the ABCA4 mouse model of Stargardt disease, consistent with slowing of the disease."

MLPA analysis as well as sequencing of two regions in introns 30 and 36 reported earlier to harbor deep intronic disease-associated variants was used in 4 selected cases.Results: An overall detection rate of at least one mutant allele was achieved in 52 of the 59 patients (88.1%). Direct sequencing improved significantly the complete characterization rate, that is, identification of two mutations compared to the microarray analysis (93.1% versus 50%). In total, 40 distinct potentially disease-causing variants of the ABCA4 gene were detected, including six previously unreported potentially pathogenic variants. Among the disease-causing variants, in this cohort, the most frequent was c.5714+5G&gt;A representing 16.1%, while p.Gly1961Glu and p.Leu541Pro represented 15.2% and 8.5%, respectively.Conclusions: By using a combination of methods, we completely molecularly diagnosed 48 of the 59 patients studied.

ABCA4,Extremely hypomorphic and severe deep intronic variants in the ABCA4 locus result in varying Stargardt disease phenotypes., 2018 Aug 1,"Zernant J, Lee W, Nagasaki T, Collison FT, Fishman GA, Bertelsen M, Rosenberg T, Gouras P, Tsang SH,, Allikmets R,.","Autosomal recessive Stargardt disease (STGD1, MIM 248200) is caused by mutations in the ABCA4 gene. Complete sequencing of the ABCA4 locus in STGD1 patients identifies two expected disease-causing alleles in ∼75% of patients and only one mutation in ∼15% of patients. Recently, many possibly pathogenic variants in deep intronic sequences of ABCA4 have been identified in the latter group. We extended our analyses of deep intronic ABCA4 variants and determined that one of these, c.4253+43G&gt;A (rs61754045), is present in 29/1155 (2.6%) of STGD1 patients. The variant is found at statistically significantly higher frequency in patients with only one pathogenic ABCA4 allele, 23/160 (14.38%), MAF = 0.072, compared to MAF = 0.013 in all STGD1 cases and MAF = 0.006 in the matching general population (P &lt; 1 × 10-7). The variant, which is not predicted to have any effect on splicing, is the first reported intronic ""extremely hypomorphic allele"" in the ABCA4 locus; that is, it is pathogenic only when in trans with a loss-of-function ABCA4 allele. It results in a distinct clinical phenotype characterized by late onset of symptoms and foveal sparing. In ∼70% of cases the variant was allelic with the c.6006-609T&gt;A (rs575968112) variant, which was deemed nonpathogenic. Another rare deep intronic variant, c.5196+1056A&gt;G (rs886044749), found in 5/834 (0.6%) of STGD1 cases is, conversely, a severe allele. This study determines pathogenicity for three noncoding variants in STGD1 patients of European descent accounting for ∼3% of the disease. Defining disease-associated alleles in the noncoding sequences of the ABCA4 locus can be accomplished by integrated clinical and genetic analyses."

SW-AF (488 nm excitation, 500-680 nm emission) and NIR-AF (excitation 787 nm, emission &gt;830 nm) images were acquired with a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope. SW-AF images were analyzed for quantitative autofluoresence (qAF). Analogous methods of image acquisition and analysis were performed in albino and pigmented Abca4 mice and wild-type mice.Results: Quantitation of SW-AF (qAF), construction of qAF color-coded maps, and examination of NIR-AF images from GPR143/OA1 carriers revealed mosaics in which patches of fundus exhibiting NIR-AF signal had qAF levels within normal limits whereas the hypopigmented areas in the NIR-AF image corresponded to foci of elevated qAF. qAF also was increased in albino versus pigmented mice. Although melanin contributes to fundus infrared reflectance, the latter appeared to be uniform in en face reflectance images of GPR143/OA1-carriers. In patients diagnosed with ABCA4-associated disease, NIR-AF increased in tandem with increased qAF originating in bisretinoid lipofuscin. Similarly in Abca4 mice having increased SW-AF, NIR-AF was more pronounced than in wild-type mice.Conclusions: These studies corroborate RPE melanin as the major source of NIR-AF but also indicate that bisretinoid lipofuscin, when present at sufficient concentrations, contributes to the NIR-AF signal. Ocular melanin attenuates the SW-AF signal."
ABCA4,Correlating the Expression and Functional Activity of ABCA4 Disease Variants With the Phenotype of Patients With Stargardt Disease., 2018 May 1,"Garces F, Jiang K, Molday LL, Stöhr H, Weber BH, Lyons CJ, Maberley D, Molday RS,.","Purpose: Stargardt disease (STGD1), the most common early-onset recessive macular degeneration, is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA4. Although extensive genetic studies have identified more than 1000 mutations that cause STGD1 and related ABCA4-associated diseases, few studies have investigated the extent to which mutations affect the biochemical properties of ABCA4. The purpose of this study was to correlate the expression and functional activities of missense mutations in ABCA4 identified in a cohort of Canadian patients with their clinical phenotype.Methods: Eleven patients from British Columbia were diagnosed with STGD1. The exons and exon-intron boundaries were sequenced to identify potential pathologic mutations in ABCA4. Missense mutations were expressed in HEK293T cells and their level of expression, retinoid substrate binding properties, and ATPase activities were measured and correlated with the phenotype of the STGD1 patients.Results: Of the 11 STGD1 patients analyzed, 7 patients had two mutations in ABCA4, 3 patients had one detected mutation, and 1 patient had no mutations in the exons and flanking regions. Included in this cohort of patients was a severely affected 11-year-old child who was homozygous for the novel p.Ala1794Pro mutation. Expression and functional analysis of this variant and other disease-associated variants compared favorably with the phenotypes of this cohort of STGD1 patients.Conclusions: Although many factors contribute to the phenotype of STGD1 patients, the expression and residual activity of ABCA4 mutants play a major role in determining the disease severity of STGD1 patients."
ABCA4,A novel small molecule chaperone of rod opsin and its potential therapy for retinal degeneration., 2018 May 17,"Chen Y,,, Chen Y,, Jastrzebska B,, Golczak M,, Gulati S,, Tang H, Seibel W, Li X, Jin H, Han Y, Gao S, Zhang J, Liu X, Heidari-Torkabadi H, Stewart PL,, Harte WE, Tochtrop GP, Palczewski K,.","Rhodopsin homeostasis is tightly coupled to rod photoreceptor cell survival and vision. Mutations resulting in the misfolding of rhodopsin can lead to autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP), a progressive retinal degeneration that currently is untreatable. Using a cell-based high-throughput screen (HTS) to identify small molecules that can stabilize the P23H-opsin mutant, which causes most cases of adRP, we identified a novel pharmacological chaperone of rod photoreceptor opsin, YC-001. As a non-retinoid molecule, YC-001 demonstrates micromolar potency and efficacy greater than 9-cis-retinal with lower cytotoxicity. YC-001 binds to bovine rod opsin with an EC<sub>50</sub> similar to 9-cis-retinal. The chaperone activity of YC-001 is evidenced by its ability to rescue the transport of multiple rod opsin mutants in mammalian cells. YC-001 is also an inverse agonist that non-competitively antagonizes rod opsin signaling. Significantly, a single dose of YC-001 protects Abca4  Rdh8  mice from bright light-induced retinal degeneration, suggesting its broad therapeutic potential."
ABCA4,Novel variants identified with next-generation sequencing in Polish patients with cone-rod dystrophy., 2018 Apr 26,"Wawrocka A, Skorczyk-Werner A, Wicher K, Niedziela Z,, Ploski R, Rydzanicz M, Sykulski M, Kociecki J, Weisschuh N, Kohl S, Biskup S, Wissinger B, Krawczynski MR,.","Purpose: The aim of this study was to identify the molecular genetic basis of cone-rod dystrophy in 18 unrelated families of Polish origin. Cone-rod dystrophy is one of the inherited retinal dystrophies, which constitute a highly heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by progressive dysfunction of photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells.Methods: The study group was composed of four groups of patients representing different Mendelian inheritance of the disease: autosomal dominant (AD), autosomal recessive (AR), X-linked recessive (XL), and autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive (AR/XL). The combined molecular strategy included Sanger sequencing of the RPGR-ORF15 gene (three families with XL and three families with the AR/XL mode of inheritance), mutation-specific microarray analysis of the ABCA4 gene (five families with the AR mode of inheritance and two families with the AR/XL mode of inheritance), targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of inherited retinal disease-associated (IRD) genes (seven families with the AD mode of inheritance and five families with the AR mode of inheritance), and whole exome sequencing, performed in select families who had been mutation-negative in the analysis with the targeted NGS panel (one family with the AD mode of inheritance, one family with the AR mode of inheritance, and two families with the AR/XL mode of inheritance).Results: Based on this combined strategy, we managed to identify potentially causative variants in seven out of 18 families with CRD. Five of these variants are novel: c.3142_3143dupAA, p.(Glu1049Argfs*41) in the RPGR-ORF15 gene, two variants: c.1612delT, p.(Trp538Glyfs*15) and c.2389dupG, p.(Ile798Hisfs*20) in the PROM1 gene in one family, c.592A&gt;C, p.(Ser198Arg) in the PRPH2 gene and the variant c.1691A&gt;G, p.(Asp564Gly) in the ATF6 gene that we have already reported to be pathogenic. NGS on the IRD panel allowed the molecular basis of CRD to be identified in four out of 14 families with a total detection rate of 38%. WES allowed identification of the molecular genetic basis of CRD in one family.Conclusions: This is the first report on the spectrum of disease genes and pathogenic variants causing CRD in the Polish population. The study presents five novel variants identified in four genes and therefore, broadens the spectrum of probable pathogenic variants associated with CRD."
